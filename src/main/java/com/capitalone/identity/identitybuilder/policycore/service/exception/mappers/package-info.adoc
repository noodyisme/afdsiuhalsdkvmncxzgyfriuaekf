Exception Mappers Package Info

This package is meant to be included in your Jersey runtime by registering the classes in your ResourceConfig class.
You can do so by adding the following lines of code:
....
 register(JsonMappingExceptionMapper.class);
        register(JsonParseExceptionMapper.class);
        register(JsonProcessingExceptionMapper.class);
....
**_OR_**
....
 registerClasses(JsonProcessingExceptionMapper.class, JsonMappingExceptionMapper.class, JsonParseExceptionMapper.class);
....

Please ensure that the exception mapper classes you include come from **_OUR_** `+com.capitalone.identity.identitybuilder.policycore.service.exception.mappers+` package.

If for some reason, an additional ExceptionMapper is needed, the class can be added to this package and no additional
registration should be needed in the Jersey Runtime (restart required to load new ExceptionMapper)

Please ensure that any new ExceptionMapper is unit tested and integration tested. A good starting point for this is the
`+com.capitalone.identity.identitybuilder.policycore.service.exception.mappers+` test package.
